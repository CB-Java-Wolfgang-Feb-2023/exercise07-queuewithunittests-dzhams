This exercise is an extension of Exercise03_Queue.
- Now you have the task to add units tests to all of your methods.
- Make sure that you have a test coverage of 100% and that you also test the exceptions and cover all test cases.
- Use at least one parametrized test and try out some other JUNIT annotations which we have used in our course.
Of course, feel free to also try other one that we have not checked out yet :)
